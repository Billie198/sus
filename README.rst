sus: Static URL Shortener
=========================

**sus** is a static site based URL shortener. Simple idea: generate a static site with a bunch of ``redirect-slug-goes-here/index.html`` files with nothing but an HTML redirect in them.

It's under pretty heavy construction, so, uhh, keep in mind.
